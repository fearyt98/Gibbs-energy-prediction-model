# Gibbs-energy-prediction-model

This code, models, and sample data are part of the research and graduate thesis. With the help of this model, the possibility of fast and sufficiently accurate prediction of the minimum value of the Gibbs energy, as one of the factors of thermodynamic equilibrium. The model was created for metallic systems with small amounts of selected alloying components.

The model is represented by a neural network based on two architectures - a deep neural network and a convolutional neural network.

The data for model training was generated by the pycalphad with a custom multicomponent database artificially generated in the CALPHAD database format. It is also worth noting that it was not possible to obtain training data for all combinations of components used, so depending on the components, the accuracy of the model may be lower in some cases. Example, is not an absolute true for these components: data were available for Al-Mg and Mg-V, but not for Al-V.

Only binary systems were used for training, and accuracy checks were also performed for ternary systems.

The data format used for model training and prediction is as follows:

| index of vector| | feature |
|-----|---|------|
| [0] | - | temperature |
| [1] | - | concentration of Al |
| [2] | - | concentration of Mg |
| [3] | - | concentration of V |

> Example: [298.15, 0.95, 0.05, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0......] a vector of 57 elements
